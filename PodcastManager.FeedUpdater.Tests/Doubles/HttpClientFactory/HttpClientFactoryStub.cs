The <a href=\"https://www.solutionengineeringtool.company/\">Solution Engineering Tool </a>(SET) is a framework that takes an engineering-based approach to win competitive deals.<br />\n<br />\nThe Solution Engineering Tool<br />\nAs a Navy officer, Peter lived on a ship, which he described as a system of systems. After leaving the Navy, he started consulting in the Pentagon, assessing complex weapons systems. Peter connected building a complex system and doing business development and capture and proposal planning. Peter began using different mental models he developed from his experiences to win deals. He was eventually encouraged to develop this into a <a href=\"https://killerinnovations.com/4-required-elements-of-an-innovation-framework-2/\">framework</a>, and the Solution Engineering Tool (SET) was born. SET is a tool of tools, holding sixty-one tools that companies of all sizes can use and for deals of all sizes and timeframes.<br />\nThe Importance of Critical Thinking<br />\nInnovators often fail to think enough about their innovation\'s value critically. This critical thinking failure is where SET comes into play. SET starts with an issue and key factor analysis. The goal is to <a href=\"https://killerinnovations.com/brainstorming-problem-statements-as-a-team/\">understand the problem</a>, why it\'s a problem, and identify the critical problems and why they are problems. After that, it\'s a matter of showing the value your innovation offers.<br />\nThe Engineering Behind the Framework<br />\nWhen SET is used, it stores a data lake of competitive intelligence. SET provides a digital and visual blueprint that federates all the thinking behind how you got to a win. Many companies can\'t repeat successes because they didn\'t document the process behind them. SET collects strategies behind wins to be built upon and repeated in the future. SET\'s root cause analysis helps identify areas of success and areas that need improvement. In the case of a loss, the compiled data can see where things went wrong. Peter says no matter what <a href=\"https://killerinnovations.com/9-types-of-innovation-tools/\">innovation tool</a> you use, it\'s not the tool that makes you successful. It is how you use it. SET is meant to facilitate collaborative analysis to help you make decisions on strategies you apply, potential teams to partner with, who you should hire, and give reasons as to why your company should win a deal.<br />\nTo know more about Peter Lierni and the Solution Engineering Tool (SET) framework, listen to this week\'s show: <a href=\"http://traffic.libsyn.com/philmckinney/Peter_Lierni_of_Solutioneering_on_Innovating_Frameworks_for_Critical_Thinking.mp3\">Peter Lierni of Solutioneering on Innovating Frameworks for Critical Thinking</a>.<br />\n<br />\nInnovation doesn\'t happen by accident.

Tim Bajarin joins us from Silicon Valley to discuss work from home shifts and the newest innovations from Apple.<br />\n<br />\nTim Bajarin On WFH Shifts<br />\nOver the last eighteen months, businesses have realized that bringing everybody back to the office isn’t realistic. People are comfortable with the flexibility that working from home provides. Creative Strategies did several studies on this topic and discovered that people establish <a href=\"https://killerinnovations.com/bob-odonnell-of-technalysis-research-what-innovation-impacts-you/\">sophisticated work from home set-ups</a>. Because people want consistency with their office and work from home, IT directors face new challenges. Even when in-office, people are still connecting with clients and colleagues virtually.<br />\nBecause people now want studios in their homes for work, homeschooling kids, etc., the housing demand has skyrocketed. Architects are currently designing new custom homes that include studios. We are moving towards the hybrid environment being the norm. Large and small companies have been investing in sprucing up their offices for their employees to match their WFH settings.<br />\nShifts in Technology<br />\nCOVID has opened room for more <a href=\"https://killerinnovations.com/eric-yuan-and-the-future-of-zoom/\">innovative technologies</a>. People want better cameras, pushing laptop makers and other tech companies to make heavy improvements. Intel competitors have evolved, such as AMD and Qualcomm. Apple’s introduction of the M1 Chip has immensely shaken things up in the valley. The demand for Macs has increased immensely as well. <a href=\"https://killerinnovations.com/what-is-the-optimal-innovation-team-size/\">Apple</a> is innovating on so many fronts and has the patience to stay in it for the long run.<br />\nRegulatory Pressures<br />\nGovernment regulation has become more prevalent, specifically with the European Union, as it attempts to harness the growth of companies like Apple and Facebook. Tim says that Washington D.C does not understand technology, which has caused some issues. While they talk significantly about clamping down on things, the reality is that great economic challenges will arise if governing bodies step in.<br />\nAbout our Guest: Tim Bajarin<br />\nTim Bajarin is one of <a href=\"https://killerinnovations.com/tim-bajarin-future-innovation-platforms/\">the most recognized and sought-after global technology analysts</a>, futurists, and consultants.

Bob O\'Donnell<a href=\"https://killerinnovations.com/on-the-cusp-of-innovation-bob-odonnell-surveys-ces-2019-s14-ep47/\"> joins us</a> to discuss the innovation impacts of broadband and 5G.<br />\n<br />\nInnovation Impacts of Remote Work<br />\nCOVID-19 dramatically changed how we communicate, increasing the need for fast, consistent broadband. The broadband industry globally builds around two and a half years of capacity ahead of time. High internet usage spikes from COVID resulted in <a href=\"https://killerinnovations.com/thoughts-on-innovation/\">broadband capacity</a> exhaustion 14 days after March 1, 2020. The spikes were due to people working from home and kids being home from school. Zoom, WebEx, Microsoft, etc., all came together to improve the problems.<br />\nA strong work-from-home environment is the byproduct of the shift from in-person to remote. To build out their mobile workstations, people invest in high-quality PCs, monitors, cameras, platforms, etc. Bob believes there will continue to be an &#8220;<a href=\"https://philmckinney.com/are-you-unconventional-enough-in-your-thinking/\">explosion of installs</a>&#8221; of different video calling platforms.<br />\nThe Accelerated Pace of Technology Innovation<br />\nCompetition in the tech world has seen accelerated growth since COVID-19 started. There are four or five video conferencing platforms most people are currently using.<a href=\"https://killerinnovations.com/eric-yuan-and-the-future-of-zoom/\"> Zoom</a>, for instance, released 320 new features last year. When it comes to microchips, things have never been more competitive. Intel and AMD are working with global governments on semiconductor and supply chain issues. Technological innovations are continuously rolling out.<br />\n5G Innovation Growth<br />\nWhen it comes to <a href=\"https://killerinnovations.com/innovation-in-5g-capabilities/\">5G innovation</a>, most of the world started out using mid-band frequencies. The U.S started with low and high-band frequencies. Mid-band turned out to be the fastest, leaving U.S 5G efforts off to a slow start. Like Y2K, everybody knew 5G was coming but did not plan for it properly. However, things are now starting to pick up.<br />\nThe world\'s leading proponents on 5G private networks, Vodafone Germany recently unveiled a private network at Porsche\'s main factory. Everything at the factory runs on a 5G network, which does real-time tuning on the car while it\'s on a test track. Bob is currently working on a study of private 5G and how companies are implementing it. Everybody is talking about private 5G and its potential impacts from chip manufacturers to software, devices, and networks.<br />\nAbout our Guest: Bob O\'Donnell<br />\nBob O\'Donnell is the President, Founder, and Chief Analyst of TECHnalysis Research.
